# Hands on 5: Technology mapping

Take a benchmark circuit (an AIG, BLIF, Verilog – whatever you’ve got).

Map it twice
a. First onto a Standard-Cell Library (SCL) you supply.
b. Then onto k-input LUTs (once directly, once via a larger LUT and decomposition).

Play with structural-bias options (dch, larger-LUT-first, etc.) and compare area/delay numbers.

Hand in the mapped Verilog (or the stats tables your instructor wants) plus a short “this is faster/smaller because …” commentary.
