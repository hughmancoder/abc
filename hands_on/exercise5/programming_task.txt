I. Technology Mapping Using Standard Cell Libraries (SCL)

1. Types of Libraries:
- Genlib Format:
  A simplified library format that resembles the information used during technology mapping. Each cell has one area value and one value for each rise and fall delay.

- Liberty Format:
  This file format is used for tasks where detailed descriptions of the cells are important. These descriptions are usually extracted using SPICE simulations and require significant effort to produce.
  In the Liberty format, the header includes general information such as units, nominal temperature, and templates for power and delay.
  For each output pin of a standard cell, the Boolean function (used for Boolean matching) and a detailed analysis of its power behavior (static and dynamic) and timing are provided.
  The dynamic power and timing are specified using an 8x8 matrix depending on the input transition time and total output net capacitance (e.g., delay_template_8x8_12, power_template_8x8_12).
  Since this level of detail is too fine-grained for technology mapping and abstraction layers are still used, ABC simplifies these values into the Genlib format.

2. Standard Cell Technology Mapping in ABC:
- To read the respective library, use the commands "read_genlib" and "read_lib".
- To create a mapping and write it to a file, use the commands "map" and "write_verilog file.v".
- In the generated file, you can observe a mapped netlist where the cells from your SCL are used with specific signals connected to their input and output pins.

- Structural Bias:
  - When reading in a library, ABC automatically creates supergates by combining single cells to generate a wider range of Boolean functions for matching.
  - To use structural choices, use the command "dch". Try mapping a benchmark using "map" with and without "dch" and compare the results.

II. Add-on for Technology Mapping into LUTs

1. General:
- When mapping into LUTs, a k-LUT can implement any Boolean function with k inputs. Use the command: "if -K k".
- This means that Boolean matching is not necessary. Instead, the truth tables of the cuts selected during mapping are used directly.
- In LUT mapping, a unit-delay and unit-area model is typically used, meaning that each LUT has delay and area equal to 1.

2. Structural Bias in Technology Mapping:
- Structural choices can also be applied in LUT mapping.
- Additionally, decomposition techniques can be used to mitigate structural bias. Here, the network is first mapped into larger LUTs (greater than k), and then decomposed into k-LUTs.
- During decomposition, the process is no longer tied to the AIG structure and can use other representations such as truth tables (TT), sum-of-products (SOP), or binary decision diagrams (BDD).
- You can apply delay-oriented mapping using the command "if -K 8 -Z 6". This maps the circuit into 8-LUTs first and then decomposes them into 6-LUTs, often resulting in better delay.
- Try this on different benchmarks and compare it with direct mapping into 6-LUTs using "if -K 6".
